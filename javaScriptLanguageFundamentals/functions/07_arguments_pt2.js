// Arguments Part 2
// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code
// until after you have tried to answer.

var a = 7;

function myValue(a) {
  a += 10;
}

myValue(a);
console.log(a);

// same as previous problem - since 7 is a primitive, no change but also with variable shadowing
