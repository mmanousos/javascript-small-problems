Remove some exclamation marks to keep the same number of exclamation marks at 
the beginning and end of each word. Words are separated by spaces in the 
sentence. Please note: only can remove, can not append.

Examples
remove("Hi!") === "Hi"
remove("!Hi! Hi!") === "!Hi! Hi"
remove("!!Hi! !Hi!!") === "!Hi! !Hi!"
remove("!!!!Hi!! !!!!Hi !Hi!!!") === "!!Hi!! Hi !Hi!"
