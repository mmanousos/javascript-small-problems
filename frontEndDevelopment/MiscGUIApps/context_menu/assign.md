In the previous exercise, you create a todo list application that uses a confirmation dialog when deleting a todo. Make the following changes to your solution.

Specifications
The program should function in the same way as the previous version except as follows:

When the user right clicks a todo item, display a context menu.
The context menu has three items:

You don't need to add functionality for Show details and Edit Todo.
